noise

http://documen.tician.de/pycuda/array.html#module-pycuda.curandom

PyCuda has built-ins for generating noise, so this could be done
either for single steps or multiple steps at once

delays
``````

requires same indexing approach but maybe we'll be able to improve
over basic approach by being clever. the distribution of delays
could be relevant for some batch-partition scheme.

sparse coupling matrix
